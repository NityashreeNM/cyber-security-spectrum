## 1. Overview

Security Engineering is the disciplined application of security principles, architecture, controls, technologies, and engineering practices throughout the lifecycle of systems and products.

Security Resilience extends this capability by ensuring that organizations and systems can:

- Software engineering
- Product security
- Cloud security
- IoT security
- OT and ICS security
- Cyber-physical systems
- Business continuity
